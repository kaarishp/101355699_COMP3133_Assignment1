What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015.

Why Use GraphQL?

Efficiency: GraphQL enables clients to request only the data they need, minimizing bandwidth usage and improving performance.
Flexibility: Clients can specify exactly what data they require, allowing for more dynamic and efficient queries.
Strong Typing: GraphQL schemas define the structure of the data available, providing type safety and improved developer experience.
Single Endpoint: Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint, simplifying API management and reducing network overhead.
Evolutionary: GraphQL supports gradual API evolution without impacting clients, making it easier to iterate and improve APIs over time.
